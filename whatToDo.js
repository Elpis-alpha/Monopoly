  So at the point I halted this program, let's review what's happening
  
  This is the end of the Covid 19 break, we are finally resuming online

  lectures. After spending 6+ months (of he*l) at home, Fred and I are 

  finally going to school. Online lectures begin on the 8th of Febuary


  Now that we're done with reminisce of the old, detestable and forgotten

  memories, lets move into the main stuff


  As at this moment here's what has been done to the Monopoly Game:

  1. I've created the board

  2. I've created a function to roll die i.e spins like a spinner

  3. I've created a function to move cells

  4. I've created all possible cards to be displayed on the board

  5. I've completely set up the entry process into the game

  6. All relatively basic display of information from click events are done


  And here's what needs to be done

  1. Although the board is created, it's content aren't responsive

  2. The height of the board should be adjusted fo fit full screen on any phone

  3. I need to track the data- attributtes throughout each stage of the game

  4. The fillBoard() function should set all the data- attributes involved

  5. The computer should be able to process trade deals

  6. The endTurn under ComputerResponse should send trades, build houses, sell or

      mortgage if neccessary

  7. Tracking where the player left is still incomplete. (play, playing or played)

  8. One of the main functions landOnCard is yet to be made

  9. Library (API) of Chance and Community Deck is yet to be made


  With all that said, there's still a lot of work to be done, and I strongly

  advice you not to touch this untill part 5 because it is too overwhelming

  like seriously, don't forget what is really important



  Wish you Good Luck in everything
